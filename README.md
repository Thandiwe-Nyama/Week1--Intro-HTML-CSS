DAY1: INTRODUCTION ON HTML AND CSS.
HTML is whereby we used a website apps and various software whenever web technology is involved.
HTML elements: start tag <p>, the element content, and end tag</p>.

HTML syntax in content we got a short paragraph that uses emphasized text for effect.
The paragraph itself is wrapped up in opening and closing tag.
There is another element called NESTED <em> emphasized text </em> for effect.
HTML paragraph. HTML has three chunks of text were browser shows the three paragraphs as a single chunks of text.
We use HTML tahs to indicate the paragraph.
We add opening tag(<p>) before the first paragraph and a closing tag(</p>) at the end of each paragraph.
e.g <p> 
The browser can now recognize these paragraph as individual pieces of text because we have given it the right instruction.
HTML Headlines 
Web pages usually contain various titles, headlines, and subheadings. The HTML elements are used for marking up headlines comes with six different types: h1, h2, h3, h4, h5 and h6.
h1 is the largest and most prominent, while h6 is the smallest and least attention-grabbing.
In order to select appropriate headline level is generally straightforward: start with opening(h1) and end with closing tag.
First label h1 while second one is h2, we tell that the first one is bigger than the second one(h2). h1 is serves as the main title, while the h2 act as a subtitle for the cotent.
The choice of the headline level is not based on the appearance but on its meaning. Hierarchical system of headlines gives meaning to the browser, distinguishing what is most important from what is less important.
It also ensure that all articles headlines share the same type, h2 which crucial for screen reader users who rely n consistent hierarchical information to navigate the page.
